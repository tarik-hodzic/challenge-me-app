## Note on Contributions
Due to switching GitHub accounts during development, some commits appear under `aminabrkovic` and others under `brkii`. Both represent the same contributor.

## Another Note**
All project functionalities are working correctly. However, on some versions of Android Studio, JDK 17(or 15, depending on user) is required. To ensure compatibility, simply update the JDK version to 17(or 15) in the Gradle build scripts.
